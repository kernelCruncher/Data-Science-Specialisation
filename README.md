# Data-Science-Specialisation

This repository contains work I completed for a 10 course specialisation in Data Science at the end of 2018. Some of the exercises required various scripts to be written in the statistical programming language R, but perhaps the most interesting work is in the Capstone directory. It involved creating a Natural Language Processing application in RShiny to predict the next word in the users's input. The app relied upon a series of n-gram models that had been trained on extracts from news, blog and Twitter corpuses that we had cleaned and tokenized, before computing a Document Term Matrix. Unfortunately, the corpus files en_US.blogs, en_US.news and en_US.twitter were too big to commit to the repo, but can easily be found on the web.

As part of the specialisation we had to publish several of our projects online. here are the links to my work:
